	abstract = {Rising prevalence of diabetes worldwide has necessitated the implementation of population-based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening programs that can perform retinal imaging and interpretation for extremely large patient cohorts in a rapid and sensitive manner while minimizing inappropriate referrals to retina specialists. While most current screening programs employ mydriatic or nonmydriatic color fundus photography and trained image graders to identify referable DR, new imaging modalities offer significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, throughput, and affordability. Smartphone-based fundus photography, macular optical coherence tomography, ultrawide-field imaging, and artificial intelligence-based image reading address limitations of current approaches and will likely become necessary as DR becomes more prevalent. Here we review current trends in imaging for DR screening and emerging technologies that show potential for improving upon current screening approaches.},

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8Ã— deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},
